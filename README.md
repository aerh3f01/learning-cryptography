# My Slow Journey to Learn Cryptographic Principles and Making Ciphers in Python

## About This Project
Welcome to my project repository where I document my journey in learning cryptographic principles and developing ciphers using Python. 
This project is a personal educational endeavor aimed at understanding the intricacies of cryptography and its implementation.

## Educational Purpose
The scripts and programs in this repository are designed for educational purposes only. 
They are part of my learning journey in the field of cryptography and are intended to demonstrate the basic principles of encryption, decryption, and potentially hacking techniques. 
**Please note that the encryption methods developed here are not suitable for real-world security applications.**

## How to Use
You can explore the various Python scripts that illustrate different cryptographic concepts and ciphers. 
Most files contain reasonable comments to explain features and functions of each script.
